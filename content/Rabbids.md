**Rabbids**, also known as **Raving Rabbids** (French: **Lapins Cr√©tins**), is a multimedia franchise developed and published by Ubisoft. It originated as a spin-off video game from the Rayman video game series, 2006's Rayman Raving Rabbids. Rabbids is centered on a titular fictional species of mischievous rabbit-like creatures, who speak gibberish and scream wildly whenever they experience an adrenaline rush. Most video games from the franchise are of the party video game genre, though other genres have been explored as well.
The Rabbids were initially introduced as antagonists in the Rayman series of games. The popularity of the characters, aided by various viral videos and media appearances, led Raving Rabbids to become its own separate franchise, dropping the Rayman name as of 2009's Rabbids Go Home. The success of the Rabbid characters led the developers to create more games in the franchise, eventually leading to the removal of Rayman from the branding entirely.
The Rabbids have gone on to appear in other expanded media, such as a TV show and a feature film in development, as well as making guest appearances in other Ubisoft games. As of June 2019, the series had sold over 20 million units worldwide. A film adaptation is in development by Lionsgate, Ubisoft Film & Television, Mandeville Films, & Stoopid Buddy Stoodios.

## Characters
* **Rabbids** --- Rabbids are wild rabbit-like creatures. They like to cause havoc and mischief on Rayman's world, the human world and others, and are gibberish speaking and yell "Bwah!" whenever they experience adrenaline rushes. They were originally the antagonists; however, due to increase in popularity, they became the protagonists in Rabbids Go Home. Two notable Rabbids who first appeared in Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle are Rabbid Mario and Rabbid Peach.
* **Rayman** --- the main protagonist of the first three games. He always foils the Rabbids' plans. When the Rabbids became the protagonists of the franchise, Rayman was dropped, but continues to appear in his own games. He appears as a playable character in a Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope downloadable content.
* **Professor Barranco II** --- Professor Barranco II is the supreme leader of all Rabbids. He is seen wearing black glasses and surgical equipment, and he is responsible for everything in the first Rayman Raving Rabbids. In promotional videos he can be seen designing contraptions that would appear in the game. He, alongside three other leaders, is the smartest Rabbid to exist outside of the 2010 TV series.
* **Professor Barranco III** --- the third leader of the Rabbids, who planned out all of their invasions on Rayman's world, Earth and others. He is seen in the games Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, Rabbids: Travel in Time and Rabbids: Alive and Kicking as the main antagonist. He is one of the rare smart Rabbids to exist after the events of Rabbids Go Home, but can be easily fooled as well. In Rabbids: Alive and Kicking he has a Rabbid scientist as his second in command, who would later go on to become a major character in the TV series. He is heterochromic, with blue and red eyes. He appears in the TV series, but is more of a dictator to his Rabbid minions.
* **Serguei** --- Serguei is the main villain of Rayman Raving Rabbids. He is a large, black Rabbid who abducted Rayman and the Globox kids and forced them to take part in the Rabbids Olympics filled with deadly challenges. In the end, Rayman manages to escape and free most of the Globox kids. It is unknown what happens to Serguei at that point, though his absence in further games suggest that he was relieved of his duties due to failure in keeping Rayman.
* **The Semi-Leaders** --- the Semi-leaders are fat, lazy and angry Rabbids who serve as the secondary antagonists of Rayman Raving Rabbids 2. They constantly force the Rabbids to bring them food and do not do pretty much anything other than sitting or lying around and keeping things in check. They each have different themes in clothing.
## Reception
The Rabbids series, along with its titular characters, have become very popular. IGN has stated that the Rabbids have "more personality and charisma than 10 of the most popular video game mascots combined", and that the bunnies have literally "upstaged Rayman himself".
GameSpot noted that the Rabbids themselves are "almost exclusively responsible for *"selling the game's humor"*, as they are, without a doubt, hysterical. They're adorably designed, with their dumb stares, high-pitched shrieks, and a penchant for taking comedic bumps.".
