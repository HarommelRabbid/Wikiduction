Grizzy and the Lemmings is set in Nutty Hill National Forest, a fictional Canadian park, at the hillside cabin of the park's mostly unseen forest ranger. When the ranger leaves for work each day, Grizzy, a grizzly bear, slips into the cabin and takes advantage of its numerous amenities, usually seeking to relax, watch television and snack. He always finds his peace disturbed by a pack of rambunctious and mischief-making blue-gray lemmings who all have similar personalities.

As Grizzy and the lemmings are drawn into conflict, various pieces of high-tech equipment and sometimes magic objects in and around the cabin come into play, as the lemmings seek to make more mischief and Grizzy tries to stop them. The battle almost invariably spills onto the passing highway and beyond, leading to high-speed chases. Every episode ends in a bad ending with Grizzy and the lemmings trapped in some sort of undesirable and apparently inescapable situation. As with similar cartoons, in spite of the terrible things that happen, no one is ever permanently injured. They are hit by log trucks, shot by rockets, crushed by boulders, electrocuted, blown up by explosives and so on but always come back to try again.
